# Personal Blog Website
- this is my personal website made using gatbsy themes

## Editing
- edit the styles etc in `gatsby-theme-clear-blog`
- the project uses yarn workspaces so to execute a command from root use e.g. `yarn workspace example develop`

## TODO:
- ensure that my personal site is shown on example and not in the gatsby theme-clear-blog
- connect to Netlify CMS easily.
