# Gatsby Modern Portfolio Theme

This theme to write a portfolio from just one markdown file.


## Features
- Write a simple portfolio site from just one markdown file
- ability to change the styles (colors and typography)

## Out of Scope
- Ability to blog - hopefully this can be *composed* with another theme later.

## TODO:
- add a favicon
- allow the user to set the font and color theme (see how [mdx-blog](https://github.com/jxnblk/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog/tree/master/example) has done this)
- integrate with netlify-cms.

## With thanks to:
-  [These](https://github.com/sw-yx/gatsby-theme-dev-blog/tree/master/src) [two](https://github.com/jxnblk/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog/tree/master/example)   great working examples of themes.
-  The Gatsby team to great documentation.
-  For this (WHERE) website for the style inspiration.
